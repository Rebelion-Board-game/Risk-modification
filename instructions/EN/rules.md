+--------------------+
|  **General rules** |
| =================  |
+--------------------+

1.  The game takes place on a map divided into 6 continents. Each of
    them is divided into territories.

2.  A player can only move his battalions between adjacent territories,
    i.e. those that share a common border or are connected by a line on
    the water.

3.  Each player gets 4 currencies at the start of their turn. The exact
    rules for receiving money are described in the \"Currency\" section.

4.  You can freely leave an occupied field without consequences and
    occupy empty areas.

5.  There are no deals over the game. If the players as heads of state
    sign a deal and set up a guarantor, it\'s up to them to keep that
    deal. In the event of a breach of contract, no immediate payment is
    made. The player must provide the payment himself or may not do so
    at all.

6.  A player may only build on conquered lands after making peace with
    the player who owned them. The player must get these territories as
    a result of the peace conference. The only actions that can be
    performed in occupied territories are plundering, destroying
    buildings and building a road.

7.  After making an attack, the player must declare whether he is
    plundering captured lands or not. If so, he does not pay for the
    march from one province to another, which was required for the
    attack, but all buildings in this area are destroyed and 2 red
    tokens must be placed (a maximum of 5 tokens can be found in a
    province, if the player cannot add 2, he must pay) in this field. If
    the attacker does not plunder then he must pay the normal march
    price (including those that have fallen). If the attack fails, the
    attacker bears no costs.

8.  In the further part of the manual, soldiers are the combat value,
    and units and battalions are e.g. cavalry, infantryman, artillery,
    which are counted separately. Example: we have 2 horses and 1
    infantryman in the province. So we have 7 soldiers, but only 3
    units.

9.  Each player has his own sheet on which he writes active effects that
    do not have a marker, e.g. Effects of Overseas Expeditions.

\*d6 is a 6-sided die, d20 is a 20-sided die, etc.; D100 is obtained by
using a dice that has the numbers 1 to 10 and another dice that has the
numbers 10,20,\...,00. The result is read by adding two dice, e.g. we
have 6 and 40 so our result is 46. one hundred is obtained by throwing 0
and 00.

+----------------+
| **Game Start** |
| ============== |
+----------------+

1.  Each player chooses the color of his army.

2.  The game begins by choosing a capital site and placing a marker on
    the chosen province, in addition, each player takes 40 currency.
    Capitals must be at least 2 spaces apart.

3.  The player who rolls the highest number on the d100 die starts.

At the beginning of the game, players have only one province with a
capital, to increase their territory, buy soldiers and move them to an
empty province of interest (or occupied by another, if he wants to start
a fight).

+---------------+
| **Buildings** |
| ============= |
+---------------+

Buildings must be built on provinces owned, not occupied, by the player.
There cannot be any other buildings on provinces and they cannot be
connected to the capital. Buildings can be demolished, which returns
half the cost of the nominal price. Each building action must be
performed on its turn.

**BUILDINGS:**

-   A port can only be built on a province adjacent to water. The port
    guarantees a connection to the capital if it is in a sea province or
    has a connection to another port. Build cost (10), upkeep cost is 1
    currency per turn. Troops can be sent between provinces with ports
    for the normal march cost, but this action lasts 1 turn. The port is
    treated as an additional building, so you can build another building
    with it in the province. If a province with a port is being raided,
    the attacker gets an additional -8 on dice rolls.

-   Farm, gives {1} currency and 1 food income. Construction cost (14).

-   Bunkers have 2 tiers that give the defender combat modifiers (1st
    level +10; 2nd level +20). When captured, they demolish by 1 level.

-   Manufactory, gives income {2}. Construction cost (16).

-   The granary provides 2 food regardless of the weather.

-   Road, allows you to send troops between provinces without incurring
    the cost of marching. It costs (5) to build and can be built on
    provinces that have a plunder action. The road is treated as an
    additional building, so you can build another building with it in
    the province.

+------------------+
|  **sea voyages** |
| ===============  |
+------------------+

To be able to travel by sea, you must have a port.

Having a port, you can build a ship that will allow you to land on any
other sea province. The cost of building one ship is (9), one ship can
carry a maximum of 10 soldiers, the cost of marching is standard (can be
plundered) and is paid even in case of defeat. Landing troops have a -12
modifier.

The ship travels 2 turns, the player determines the landing place when
the ship departs and writes it down on a piece of paper. The destination
cannot be changed, after the ship reaches its destination, the player
shows the other players a piece of paper with the destination written on
it. The final goal must match the goal on the paper!

You can buy a construction ship that can build a port in another sea
province. The cost of such a ship is (13). Having such a ship should be
recorded on a piece of paper, it can be sent at any time in the game.

+-------------------------+
|  **Weather conditions** |
| ======================  |
+-------------------------+

Weather conditions affect the food harvest and the difficulty of
fighting battles.

Weather conditions are rolled at the start of a new turn before players
get currency or make any other move. In a turn, one player rolls, and in
the next turn, if the effect of the previous weather has ended, the next
player rolls clockwise.

The d100 die is rolled and the result is checked in the table below.
After checking the result of the roll, the player rolls a d6 to see how
long the weather lasts, then places the weather marker on the
appropriate space and moves it back 1 space each round.

  ------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Result**   **Effect**
  1-40         The usual sunny period, nothing happens.
  41-55        An unexpected winter has come. All military operations are performed with a -4 modifier (defense is not subject to this modifier)
  55-65        Extremely sunny period. All military operations are performed with a +4 modifier (defense is not subject to this modifier). And the income from each farm is increased by 1. The cost of marching is 0.
  65-75        The frost hardened the ground and froze the rivers, making crossings easier. Each unit gains an additional movement point and the cost is reduced by 1, which is {0}.
  75-85        A terrible storm makes it impossible to send any overseas expeditions, and the construction cost of each building is increased by 3. The cost of marching is increased to {2}.
  85-00        Severe winter. Each farm and manufactory\'s income is reduced by 1 and it produces 0 food instead of 1. All military operations are performed with a -8 modifier (defense is not subject to this modifier). The army march cost is 0.

1.  In each province, except the capital, there can be a maximum of 10
    units minus the amount of red tokens in the province, for each
    additional one you pay 1 currency

2.  The maintenance cost of one port is 1 currency.

3.  The cost of one soldier to move one province is 1. So the cost of
    moving a horse is 3, and so on.

+--------------+
| **battles ** |
| ============ |
+--------------+

Land Battles:
-------------

Combat takes place by rolling the d100 of both players. Each player adds
the modifiers listed below to their dice score. If troops attacking from
one province have a modifier and those from other provinces do not, then
the modifier of those units that are more is taken into account. The
player who rolls the higher score wins. In case of a tie, the defender
always wins. Soldiers die one at a time, i.e. each failed roll means the
loss of one soldier, e .g *. The attacker has 1 horse and the defender
has 2 soldiers. Both players roll the dice, the attacker has the lower
result, so he loses 1 soldier. Since 1 horse equals 3 soldiers, and one
of them died, replace the horse with 2 soldiers.*

The fight goes on until all soldiers of one side are killed or the
attacking forces decide to withdraw. In case of withdrawal, the player
does not pay the cost of marching and all soldiers return to their
original provinces.

Sea Battles:
------------

Naval battles are conducted in the same way as land battles. The player
can build 3 types of units with different values in troops that can move
around water provinces.

If a naval battle occurs, players roll a d100, the player with the
higher score wins and the opponent must subtract 1 soldier from their
fleet.

*Casper (1 corvette) leads a naval battle with Ada (2 frigates). Both
players roll a d100 die. Kacper rolled 50, Ada 67. Ada\'s result is
greater, so one soldier dies on the opponent\'s side. Casper must
replace the corvette with 3 frigates and subtract one from his army.*

A special type of ship is the transport ship, which can carry 5 soldiers
on board and decant them anywhere. This ship , if unprotected,
encounters an enemy battleship, it dies instantly along with the
soldiers on board. If there is a transport among the fleet engaged in
combat, it does not participate in the combat. If the battle was lost,
he dies immediately, if the player won the battle with the transport
ship, nothing happens.

The fleet can block an enemy port, which means that it loses all its
functions. Overseas expeditions cannot be sent from a blocked port,
ships cannot be built, and all income from fishing boats is reset to
zero for the duration of the blockade, unless the player has another
port to which fishing boats can deliver prey. To block a port, there
must be at least 1 enemy ship in a sea province that borders the port.

EXPEDITIONS:
------------

*he rolls an expedition result at the start of his turn.*

### Internal Expeditions:

> The player can choose one of his provinces without any building and
> send Expeditions to it to discover resources. The cost of such an
> action is (10). After 2 turns, the player rolls a d100 to check the
> result of the expedition. You can send one Expedition per province
> throughout the game, the bonuses for discovered minerals are not
> destroyed after conquering the territory. To get bonuses for the
> terrain, you must buy them at the end of the action, otherwise they
> are lost.

-   1-3 *you found a rare mineral. Spend (10) to gain {4} per turn.*
    \[put a piece of paper with \"K+\" written on it\]

-   4-29 you find a common mineral spend (6) to gain {3} per turn. \[put
    a piece of paper with the word \"K\"\]

-   30-70 expedition failed, found nothing.

-   71-89 you found an artifact thanks to which you gain 16 currency at
    once.

-   90-98 you found a strange poisoned water. Your actions have made the
    whole province unsuitable for building a farm or a granary. \[put a
    black card on a province\]

-   99-100 you found a tribe of savages who are taking over the area.
    D10 foot soldiers appear in the province, which is neutral. All of
    the owner\'s soldiers in the area may attack or retreat without
    casualties *.* \[the savages are thrown by the player on the right,
    they cannot move or talk to players\]. A province taken over by
    savages is not considered rebellious, nor can savages be bribed.

### Overseas expeditions.

> If the player has a Port, he can send an Overseas Expedition, cost
> (15). A player can have a maximum of 1 such expedition active. The
> action lasts 4 turns, after which the player rolls a d100 and checks
> the result in the table below.

  -------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1        The expedition found the treasure. The player gets 50 currency.
  2-6      The expedition has died and you must pay compensation to the sailors\' family. For 5 turns, your income is colder by 1.
  7-10     You found mercenaries on a certain island who wanted to join you. The player gets 2 cannons that spawn in the capital.
  11-15    You found a tribe that at first glance seemed perfect for being slaves. Unfortunately, in the country they tried to cause a rebellion, making losses. In one of the player\'s provinces, the infrastructure is destroyed, the player chooses where.
  16-18    Explorers found a rare coconut tree and brought it to your country. The player gets 10 currency and can place a piece of paper with the word \"L\" on any space he occupies. Coconut trees provide {2} extra income and allow you to send 2 expeditions at once. A player who has a tree can sell its fruits to others, because their production is 2 fruits for each tree. Each player with a Fruit Source can also send 2 Expeditions. Fruit effects are cumulative. The tree can be planted in a province with other buildings. Trees can be destroyed by a pillaging attack.
  19-20    The expedition has found a new material that is ideal for cannonballs. Bunker defense damage is permanently increased by 2.
  21-25    Your expedition has discovered a ghost ship that they have captured and now you can use it for your next expedition. The cost of the next expedition is reduced by 10.
  30-35    The expedition discovered a novel technology. The player can build four roads for free, or if he doesn\'t want to, he can sell some of them to another player or not use them at all.
  35-40    The expedition returned home with nothing. Unfortunately, they caught a tropical disease and some of your people died before you got the plague under control. The player loses 4 soldiers, he chooses which ones.
  41-45    You come across a rich tribe that your people have robbed. Gain Income {5} for 5 turns.
  46-50    Expedition time due to unfavorable winds is extended by 1 turn and the cost increases by 5. If you don\'t pay, the expedition returns with nothing.
  51-54    You have found slaves who will build a farm for you. The cost of the next 4 farms is reduced by 4.
  55-60    The explorers saw beautiful things overseas and told people who became environmentalists about it. Now, at the end of the waste economy action, the player adds 3 tokens instead of 2, for d6 turns.
  61-70    During the voyage, the captain came up with a brilliant idea. You can upgrade your capital one level for free or take the value of the upgrade cost. Example: A player has a capital city level 2, he can upgrade the capital city by 1 level for free or take 20 currency.
  76-80    The expedition fell into the hands of cannibal tribes, fortunately, most of its participants managed to escape and return home. However, their scary stories deter any daredevils from participating in such an enterprise. The cost of the next expedition increases by 5.
  81-85    The expedition found a new weapon. The player gets a permanent +3 modifier to each battle.
  86-90    The captain decided to change colors for the one who will give more. The players bid against each other (the original owner can too) and the one who bids the most rolls a die for the outcome of the overseas expedition. If no one pays, the captain returns to the original owner and he rolls for the expedition result.
  91-9 8   You come across a wonderful thing that explorers brought to your country. Unfortunately, it turned out to be poisonous. Place a black marker on 2 spaces without buildings. If a marker must be placed on a province with a building, it is destroyed or pays (10) for each marker not placed. The meaning of the marker is found in Inland Expeditions (90-98).
  99-100   The expedition returned with nothing. A few days after they returned, all the sailors died of a mysterious disease that began to spread to their families and the entire city. A worldwide plague has begun. Place the pestilence card next to the board and check the placeholder side .
  -------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Building an infrastructure (road) costs (5). Upkeep is (1) per turn
    for each province you own with this upgrade. Having infrastructure
    means that units, as long as they move around provinces with
    infrastructure, do not incur the cost of moving troops. When moving
    from a hex with a road to a hex without it, the player does not
    incur the cost of marching.

2.  You can run a robbery economy in your province. Cost (-) {income 2
    per turn for 3 turns}. \[If you run a predatory economy , place a
    card with the inscription \"R\" and one token on the province. Add
    one token every turn. After this action, remove the \"R\" card and
    place 2 tokens on the province and remove one each turn. You can
    stop this action at any time. Until all tokens are gone, you cannot
    perform any actions in the province except build infrastructure. In
    a field with tokens, the maximum number of units is (10 - the number
    of tokens) for each additional unit, standard costs are incurred.
    This action can only be taken when there is no other effect or
    building in the province.

3.  Every 2 provinces require 1 food. In case of shortage, the player
    loses d4 (d6 if the player controls at least 12 provinces) soldiers
    or pays their currency equivalent. The farm produces 1 food and the
    capital produces 3. Food can be sold abroad.

FISHING BOATS
-------------

A player with a port can build a fishing boat (7). A fishing boat has 2
movement points and, when placed on a sea province, provides 1 food and
1 currency. There can be a maximum of 1 fishing boat on one sea
province. If all ports are blocked by the player who owns the cutters,
those ships do not bring any income.

SLAVERY
-------

After winning a land battle, the player who owns the [Slave Camp
building]{.underline} may try to capture enemy soldiers as slaves. A
slave placed on a hex with a building that has upkeep costs reduces
those costs by 1. Placing a slave on a hex with a farm causes that
building to produce one more food unit. If a player whose slave works in
a province captures a territory, the slave becomes that player\'s
soldier again. If another player captures the province, he may kill the
slave or send it to work in his provinces (2 movement points, no
relocation costs).

After each lost battle against a player whose soldiers are slaves, the
owner rolls a d100 to see if there is a mutiny.

+------------------+------------------------+
| Number of slaves | A chance for rebellion |
+------------------+------------------------+
| > 1              | > 5%                   |
+------------------+------------------------+
| > 2              | > 15%                  |
+------------------+------------------------+
| > 3              | > thirty%              |
+------------------+------------------------+
| each next        | > +5%                  |
+------------------+------------------------+

After the battle, the player who wants to capture a slave rolls a D100
and checks to see if he has caught anyone.

The base chance is 20%. For each infantry or artillery unit left after
the battle, the player gets +5%. For each remaining cavalryman, the
player gets a +15% modifier.

A player can capture a maximum number of slaves equal to the number of
enemy soldiers taking soldiers in the battle. The player can kill any
part of the captured slaves. The transport of slaves takes place as
usual (2 movement points) without paying for the passage.

  -------------------------------------------- ---------------------------
  The number of enemy soldiers in the battle   Number of captured slaves

  =\>10                                        d10
  -------------------------------------------- ---------------------------

Currency:
---------

1.  Each player at the beginning of his turn gets 4 or 5 currency from
    the capital (depending on its level);

2.  You gain currency per turn equal to the number of provinces you own
    divided by 3, rounded down;

3.  Currency can be obtained from buildings such as: farms,
    manufactories, etc.

+----------+
| **Army** |
| ======== |
+----------+

1.  Cannon destroys bunkers (-4 bunker defense for each cannon in the
    army);

2.  Infantry can dig in if there are no bunkers in the area (+2
    regardless of number) ;

3.  Movement points (2 infantry, 1 artillery, 3 horse);

4.  Military can only be replaced in the capital after trading and
    buying have no movement points;

5.  Recruitment is possible only in the capital;

6.  You can combine a horse with a cannon to form a so-called caravan to
    increase the mobility of the cannon (+1 movement points); The horse
    and cannon become one unit with strength (6) and movement points
    (2); cavalry loses 2 movement points for connecting and
    disconnecting; the cannon after disconnection has no movement
    points; when connected, the caravan has 1 movement point; If there
    is a battle in which the cannon is changed to smaller battalions,
    the horse automatically disappears;

7.  Three soldiers is one horse, 2 horses is one cannon or 6 soldiers;

8.  Battalions can be disbanded at any time, no refund is given.

9.  You can summon as many **[soldiers at one time]{.underline}** as the
    number of provinces you own times 2;

+------------+
| **Agents** |
| ========== |
+------------+

Players can buy a spy for 8 currency, the condition to buy and use
agents is to have capital level 1. After buying a spy, the player gets
secret action cards. On his turn, a player distributes the face down
cards to all players, including himself. After the cards are dealt,
return the rest to the box. At the end of each new turn, secret action
cards are revealed by each player. Each player who got the action rolls
whether it was successful and returns it to the box. If the player rolls
a result of 1-10, the enemy spy is killed. After resolving espionage
actions, the cards are dealt again to each player with at least 1 agent.
Each player gets only one set of cards with 4 actions and as many
"nothing happens" cards equal to the total number of players. One spy
can only perform one secret action.

Action types:
-------------

-   Sabotage, the player in the next turn gets income less by 6 of the
    currency (success when rolling a result greater than 60).

-   Incitement to Revolt, at the start of a player\'s turn, a mutiny (d3
    soldiers) breaks out according to the normal mutiny rules. (success
    on roll greater than 80. If there is a slave on the field, success
    is on roll greater than 60).

-   Free Slaves, one slave chosen by the player being attacked by this
    action is returned to the box.

-   Burning food, in the next turn gains food income 1 less than normal
    (success when rolling a result greater than 60).

-   Counterintelligence, each spy action has 15% less chance of success.
    This card is resolved first (instant success).

> *Counterintelligence Sabotage is only successful with a score greater
> than 75.*

-   Doing nothing, a card that does nothing...

*Example:*

*Maciek bought an agent and gave everyone the cards, and put the rest
back in the box. He only had one agent, so he could only deal one
action, the rest of the players had to do nothing. Mike was the last
player, followed by another turn, so all players reveal their action
cards. Since only Mike had a spy, each player had only one card. After
the showdown, it turned out that Bogdan got a sabotage card, so now he
has to roll a d100 to see if the action was successful.*

+--------------+
| **Revolts**  |
| ============ |
+--------------+

If a player cannot feed at least 1 province, they are at risk of mutiny
at the end of their turn. Threatened player rolls d100, scores below 80
indicate rebels. The player himself determines in which province the
rebellion breaks out, it must be an area without any buildings (except
for additional buildings that are not destroyed). The player\'s d10
soldiers mutiny and must be changed to a different color. In a selected
province, the maximum possible soldiers always rebel, if after a
province rebels the number of rebels is still less than a d10 roll, then
the player chooses the next province, and this happens until as many
soldiers rebel as rolled on the dice. Rebels cannot move or parley. If
some of the soldiers rebel in the province, there is an immediate fight
between the rebels and the rest of the soldiers in the province without
the possibility of sending reinforcements. Rebellion can also be
pacified by bribing the rebels with money. To do this, you must pay 3
currency for each mutinous soldier (this can be done by any player on
their turn, if more than one player wants to do it, there is an auction.
The player who wins gets the province with the soldiers). The player to
the left of the victim rolls for the rebel soldiers. Revolts can only
occur at the end of the affected player\'s turn. If a rebellion broke
out in a province with any non-additional building, it is destroyed.

*Casper cannot feed 1 province, so he rolls a d100 at the end of his
turn. The result is 60, so now roll a d10 to see how many rebels show
up. The player rolls a 6. He must now choose a province where the
rebellion is taking place. Casper chose a territory with 4 soldiers,
because if he rebels, he still has 2 soldiers who still have to rebel,
so Casper chooses another province with 3 soldiers, so 2 rebel (4+2=6)
and an immediate fight ensues between the two rebels and 1 right
soldier.*

Revolt can also break out if at least half of a player\'s province has
red tokens. In this case, roll d100, a result of 1-60 mutiny (d6
soldiers). If half of the province has a red token and additionally one
of them has a marker with the inscription \"R\", then the revolt breaks
out on a result of 1-70 (d10 soldiers).

+---------------+
|  **Capital**  |
| ============  |
+---------------+

The player himself chooses the place of his capital at the beginning of
the game;

In a province with a capital, you can exchange battalions (cavalry for
artillery, etc.) and recruit more battalions;

After losing a capital, a temporary recruit location is selected, but
recruiting to a temporary location increases the price of each soldier
by one; unit cost respectively: (3,9,18);

Capital defense (+10 ), bunkers cannot be built in this province,
cannons do not reduce defense. Capital defense bonuses only apply if the
original owner owns it. For each enemy capital you own, you gain an
additional 2 currency per turn.

When the original owner\'s military attempts to retake the original
capital, the defending player gets (-5) on his rolls. A province with a
capital cannot be pillaged, but you don\'t pay for marching troops when
attacked.

Nothing can be built in the capital or any actions related to the
province can be performed. The capital has a basic developed
infrastructure.

If the capital at the end of the owner\'s turn is surrounded, the
defender every red loses d6 men until he has 6 soldiers.

Each capital gives 2 food.

The capital has 3 levels. The first level allows you to buy a granary
and soldiers, the second level allows you to build a farm, ports and
cavalry, and the third level allows you to build factories and
artillery. The capital\'s 3rd level also increases income by 1, so the
capital\'s income is {5}.

+--------------+
| **Victory**  |
| ============ |
+--------------+

The winner is the player who has captured all the enemy capitals. If no
player meets this condition, the points are tallied. The player with
more points wins.

One point is scored for each province you own, each capital gives you 6
points, and you add as many points as your income would be in the next
round.
