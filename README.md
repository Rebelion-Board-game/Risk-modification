# RISK-Global-Domination-modification  
Have you ever dreamed of creating your own board game?   
If your answer is yes, then great! Me and my friends did, too.  
We decided to modify our favorite game, because after many games it was too easy for us.
We created a modification of Risk Global Domination and started playing it. After years we forgot about it, and now I decided to share this game with the community.  
I hope that together we can create an even more interesting and addictive game.
